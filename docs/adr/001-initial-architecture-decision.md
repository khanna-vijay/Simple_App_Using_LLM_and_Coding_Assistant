# ADR-001: Initial Architecture Decision for English Leap

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-07-13

## Context
We need to establish the foundational architecture for the English Leap vocabulary learning application. The application should be a modern, responsive web application that helps users learn English vocabulary through interactive methods including flashcards, quizzes, and progress tracking.

## Decision
We have decided to implement English Leap using the following architecture:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React.js with functional components and hooks
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) for consistent design system
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation
- **Build Tool**: Create React App for development setup

### Data Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: Browser localStorage for user progress and preferences
- **Dictionary Data**: Static JSON file with comprehensive word definitions
- **Audio Files**: Static MP3 files for pronunciation
- **Backup System**: File-based backup utility for data portability

### Component Architecture
- **Layout Components**: Reusable navigation and layout structures
- **Feature Components**: Modular components for flashcards, quizzes, training
- **Context Providers**: Centralized state management for dictionary, user progress, audio
- **Service Layer**: Abstracted data access and business logic

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid Development**: React ecosystem provides extensive tooling and community support
- **Offline Capability**: localStorage enables offline functionality
- **Performance**: Client-side rendering with static assets ensures fast loading
- **Maintainability**: Component-based architecture promotes code reusability
- **User Experience**: Material-UI provides consistent, accessible interface

### Negative
- **Data Limitations**: localStorage has size constraints for large datasets
- **Browser Dependency**: Application tied to browser storage capabilities
- **Scalability**: Current architecture may need revision for multi-user scenarios

### Neutral
- **Technology Stack**: Modern but well-established technologies reduce risk
- **Deployment**: Static site deployment simplifies hosting requirements

## Alternatives Considered

### Backend-Driven Architecture
- **Rejected**: Adds complexity for current single-user requirements
- **Future Consideration**: May be needed for multi-user features

### Native Mobile App
- **Rejected**: Web-first approach provides broader accessibility
- **Future Consideration**: PWA capabilities can provide mobile-like experience

### Different Frontend Frameworks
- **Vue.js**: Considered but React has larger ecosystem
- **Angular**: Too heavy for current requirements
- **Svelte**: Interesting but smaller community

## Implementation Notes
- Start with MVP focusing on core vocabulary learning features
- Implement comprehensive backup system for data portability
- Design components with future scalability in mind
- Maintain clear separation between UI and business logic
