        "word_origin": "The word 'aesthetic' was coined in German in the mid-18th century by Alexander Baumgarten from the Greek 'aisthētikos', meaning 'of sense perception', which comes from 'aisthanesthai', 'to perceive'. It was originally used in its Greek sense to mean 'relating to things perceptible by the senses'. Immanuel Kant later used it in his 'Critique of Judgment' to explore the nature of taste and beauty, which led to its modern meaning related to art and beauty.",
